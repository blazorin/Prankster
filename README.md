# Prankster

An alpha-status app of Prankster, a prank call app.

Only the authentication and Home was developed, on a .NET Maui Preview.
Due to the lack of tooling I killed this project.

Now it's on the works again but sadly not with .NET / Blazor due to incompatibility issues and lack of native APIs.

Check it out and take the code you want.
